# GPA Prediction

This repository contains, collection of data related to an educational institution and I  used this information to predict the students' future grade point average and their acceptance or probation. The [attached Excel file](Elearning-Data-cut.xls) contains a page for the input data and another page for the desired output. To learn this data, I implemented a Multilayer perceptron network that can generalize these trained examples to new input samples.
